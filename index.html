  <h3>This bat is the only bat in the United States to have large ears and a nose leaf. It is also one of the most maneuverable in flight. With short and broad wings, it can fly at low speeds using minimal energy. It has superior eyesight that allows it to capture insects direcly from foliage or the ground rather than in flight. This bat prefers to eat beetles, crickets, grasshoppers, and sphinx moths. Human disturbance and habitat loss is major issue for this bat.<br>
